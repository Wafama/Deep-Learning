# Deep-Learning

These are the results of the project for the course Deep Learning. For the coding part, I worked with four other students, while the writing part was done individually. For the whole project, including both coding and writing, I received a grade of 8.5. The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from the ISIC 2018 Challenge (training data from 2018).
